# UnixTime
Wrapper around GoLang's builtin time.Time and time.Duration.

This package allows for json marshalling to unix timestamps.

Note: Not all functionality is added yet, but would be available by casting back to the builtin type.

# Install
```bash
go get -u "peterdekok.nl/gotools/unixtime"
```

```golang
import "peterdekok.nl/gotools/unixtime"
```
